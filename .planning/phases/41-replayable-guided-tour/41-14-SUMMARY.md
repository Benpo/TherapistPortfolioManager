# Phase 41 Plan 14: Round-2 replay gap-closure (tall-panel box visibility, real export icon, Help-first finish) Summary

Closed the three CONFIRMED Round-2 replay gaps on the shipped v3 tour while upholding the locked non-interactive model: on tall settings panels the step box now stays fully on screen (scroll the anchor's TOP into view + clamp the tooltip into the viewport), the save step points at the app's real 📤 export icon in plain words, and the finish step leads with the Help center plus a breadth tease. The rejected interactive-tour ideas (R2-2/R2-3) were NOT built — D-07 stands, the overlay remains a single inert click-blocker, and the big whole-panel spotlight is untouched.

## What shipped

### Task 1 — RED (commit cd77384)
Added section **[6]** to `tests/webkit/41-rtl-geometry.mjs`: in a short (1280×600) WebKit context it mounts a deliberately taller-than-viewport anchor (2200px) + a synthetic step and drives the REAL `renderSpotlight`/`positionSpotlight` path at it, then asserts the step box (tooltip) is fully inside the viewport. RED against the current center-scroll engine — the box landed at `top=-1087, bottom=-807` (entirely above the viewport); sections [1]–[5] (spotlight branch, RTL physical side, 4-language re-render, off-center post-settle) all still passed. Kept out of `tests/run-all.js` discovery (stays under `tests/webkit/`).

### Task 2 — GREEN (commit 4d754d6)
`assets/tour.js`:
- **`renderSpotlight`** — tall-anchor scroll heuristic: an anchor whose height `>= 0.7 * innerHeight` scrolls `block:'start'` (top into view, Ben's "always scrolled all the way up") instead of `block:'center'`; short anchors still center.
- **`positionSpotlight`** — added a vertical viewport CLAMP on the tooltip's physical `top` (12px margin), applied on every render and on the one-rAF post-scroll re-measure and reflow, so the step-count box is always visible. The horizontal axis was already clamped.
- Spotlight ring untouched (big whole-panel highlight kept); overlay unchanged (single inert layer). **No tour.css change was needed** — the JS clamp alone passes the invariant for the short real tooltips.

Result: WebKit probe GREEN (exit 0); `tests/run-all.js` 153/153.

### Task 3 — real icon + copy (commit d714fef)
`assets/tour.js`:
- Save-step glyph: replaced the generic monochrome upload SVG (`innerHTML`) with the app's REAL export icon **📤 (U+1F4E4)** — the same code point `add-session.html #exportSessionBtn` renders (`&#128228;`) — injected as `textContent`. The engine now has **zero innerHTML/raw-markup** anywhere; the trust-boundary header comment (T-41-01) was updated to match.

`assets/i18n-en.js` (provisional, Ben-approved verbatim):
- `help.tour.step.save.body` — names the Export button in plain words; the false "this is its icon" deixis is gone.
- `help.tour.step.help.body` — Help-center-first + breadth tease (backups & their cadence, snippet library, Heart-Wall, export formats, and the Reporting tab), no longer Reporting-first.

`assets/i18n-{he,de,cs}.js` — machine-draft mirrors of both bodies (real Export/Reporting labels quoted per locale: ייצוא/דוחות, Exportieren/Statistiken, Exportovat/Přehledy), flagged for the Phase 42.1 native pass. No i18n KEY added or removed; every i18n value stays emoji-free (the 📤 is engine-injected).

Result: `tests/41-tour-i18n-parity.test.js` green (43 keys, parity + placeholders + no-emoji); `tests/run-all.js` 153/153; WebKit probe still GREEN.

## Verification

| Gate | Result |
|------|--------|
| WebKit probe RED before Task 2 | box `top=-1087` off-screen → exit 1 ✅ |
| WebKit probe GREEN after Task 2 | box fully in viewport → exit 0 ✅ |
| `tests/run-all.js` (jsdom suite) | 153 passed, 0 failed ✅ |
| `tests/41-tour-i18n-parity.test.js` | 4 passed, 0 failed (43 keys, no emoji) ✅ |
| Spotlight ring not shrunk | no `max-height` on `.sg-tour-spotlight` ✅ |
| Overlay stays inert | single `pointer-events:auto` layer, no new interactive hole ✅ |
| Engine innerHTML-free | no `innerHTML`/`<svg>` code remains in tour.js ✅ |

## RED→GREEN evidence

```
[6] Tall-anchor step box stays inside a short viewport (R2-1):
  PASS  probe anchor is genuinely taller than the viewport
  # BEFORE (center-scroll):  FAIL  box={"top":-1087,"bottom":-807, ...}   → exit 1
  # AFTER  (scroll-top+clamp): PASS  tall-anchor step box FULLY inside viewport → exit 0
```

## Deviations from Plan

None — plan executed as written. Two plan-anticipated non-actions:
- No test asserted the old save-step SVG/innerHTML shape, so no glyph-shape test needed updating (the plan allowed for one "if" it existed).
- `tour.css` (listed in Task 2's files) needed no edit; the plan scoped a CSS tweak as conditional ("only if the clamp needs a max-height/overflow tweak") and it did not.

## Notes / follow-ups

- EN copy is PROVISIONAL; Ben supplies final texts later (no planning needed). HE/DE/CS are machine-draft → Phase 42.1 native pass.
- Re-verification is the re-run of 41-13 (automated suite + WebKit probe), then Ben's EN replay; the Hebrew pass follows once EN is locked. Do NOT write 41-13-SUMMARY until the re-replay passes.

## R2-1 follow-up — scroll-to-page-top for orientation (2026-07-09)

Ben clarified the intent behind R2-1 after reviewing the shipped `isTall ? block:'start' : block:'center'` heuristic: on step entry the page should scroll to the **page top** so the user keeps their orientation (they still see the settings tab bar / page header — "which tab am I in") instead of being aligned to the middle/top of a long panel. This REPLACES the `isTall` heuristic.

Changes (surgical — engine not redesigned):
- **`assets/tour.js` `renderSpotlight`** — replaced the `isTall` scroll heuristic with `window.scrollTo(0, 0)` (instant) on step entry. Below-fold guard: after scrolling to top, re-measure the anchor; if the whole anchor is below the fold (`getBoundingClientRect().top >= window.innerHeight`) — the emotions accordion (`data-tour="session-heart"`) and the Save button (`data-tour="session-save"`) on the long session form — or defensively above the top (`bottom <= 0`), fall back to `scrollIntoView({ block:'center', inline:'nearest' })` so the tour never spotlights an off-screen control. Removed the now-unused `isTall` computation. Kept the first-paint `.sg-tour-instant` snap and the one-rAF post-scroll re-measure.
- **Kept**: the vertical tooltip clamp (`vClamp` block from 4d754d6) in `positionSpotlight` — the step box stays fully visible either way. Spotlight ring NOT shrunk. Overlay still inert (D-07 stands — non-interactive tour).
- **`tests/webkit/41-rtl-geometry.mjs` section [6]** — repositioned the synthetic tall anchor to `top:40` (a settings-panel header on-screen after scroll-to-top, not a below-fold control) and added a NEW assertion: `window.scrollY <= 2` on the tall-panel step. Kept the existing box-in-viewport clamp assertion.

RED→GREEN evidence:
```
[6] Tall-anchor step box stays inside a short viewport (R2-1):
  BEFORE (block:'start'):  FAIL  tall settings-panel step scrolls the PAGE to the top → scrollY=40
  AFTER  (scrollTo(0,0)):  PASS  tall settings-panel step scrolls the PAGE to the top (orientation kept)
  PASS  tall-anchor step box is FULLY inside the viewport (scroll-to-top + clamp)  [both before & after]
```
jsdom `tests/run-all.js` 153/153; WebKit probe all green.

Commits: `b99e25e` (test RED), `1316278` (tour.js GREEN).

Net effect per step: settings/panel steps + all header/nav/greeting steps land at the page top (tab bar visible = orientation); only the two low session-form controls (heart, save) bring themselves into view instead. Re-verification note above unchanged: still awaiting Ben's EN re-replay.
